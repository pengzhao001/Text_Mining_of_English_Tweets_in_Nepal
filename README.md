# Data Science Final Project

1. "data_carpentry_exploration.ipynb" contains all the codes for data carpentry and exploratory analysis with visualizations. 

2. "data_modeling.ipynb" contains all the codes for data modeling for my research question.

3. "sentiment_analysis.pptx" has the information for social media sentiment analysis and Vader sentiment package.

4. "merged_subsample_sentiment.csv" is the data set I got after data carpentry and it is used in data modeling.

5. The tweet table is very huge and the queries are slow. If you want to run the code cells by yourself please run them one by one and do not run them all together.
